# MIP_results_comparison

Automatically create comparison figures for MIP runs. Upload a folder with your results summary files to the appropriate top-level folder (e.g. `3z-debug-scenarios`) and a GitHub Action will create comparison figures.

## Dashboard results

The results are compiled as dashboards. A static version with results for each case and a series of comparisons can be accessed at <https://gschivley.github.io/MIP_results_comparison>. An interactive version that lets the user select cases for comparison and modify figures is available at <https://mip-results.shinyapps.io/mip-results>.

If the interactive shinyapps website does not work, an experimental version is also available at <https://gschivley.github.io/test-shinylive>.
